# AES Exercise SoSe2020
These are my chapertwise and exercisewise notes and comments.
Steps taken for each Quartus task
* create new project
* import pint assignment and set unused pins to tri-state input
* implement and compile vhd file
* simulation: functional and timing
* programming FPGA and test

### Exercise 1
light
* used Tim KÃ¶hler's Description in Moodle for setup plus driver installation
* followed tutorial step by step  
unused pins can be set to tri-state input via Assignments > Device > Device and Pin Options ... > Unused Pins > click arrow and select "as input tri-state"
### Exercise 2
inputoutput
* simulation was done for all pins but to verfiy the circuit only one ouptut pin has to be looked at as all vector elements are treated the same
inputANDoutput
* simulation was done for all pins but to verfiy the circuit only one ouput pin has to be looked at as all vector elements are treated the same (AND is commutative)
